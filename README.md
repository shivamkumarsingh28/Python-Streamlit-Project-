Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. It's designed to be simple enough for non-programmers to use, yet powerful enough for experienced developers.

Installation Process:

1. Install Streamlit using pip: 
    pip install streamlit 
2. Install the Streamlit CLI: 
    pip install streamlit-cli 
3. Create a new Streamlit app: 
    streamlit hello 
4. Run the app: 
    streamlit run my_app.py 


Streamlit App Starting Process:
1. Create a new file in your project directory and name it app.py or whatever you want to call it. This will be the main file of your Streamlit app. 
2. Import the Streamlit library into your file by adding this line at the top of your file: import streamlit as st 
3. Add some code to your file that will create a basic UI element, such as a text box or button, using Streamlitâ€™s API functions like st.text() or st.button(). For example, you could add this line of code to create a text box with some text in it: st.text("Hello World!") 
4. Save your file and then run it from the command line using this command: streamlit run app.py (or whatever you named your file). This will start up a local web server on your computer and open up a browser window with your Streamlit app running inside it!

Edit `/app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire. :heart:
